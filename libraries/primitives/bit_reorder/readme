Bit reoreder module readme
=============================

This module is an asyncronous adder and requires no reset or enable ports.

The adder module takes in 2 numbers, possibly with differing bit widths and
adds them together. The output bit width is set to the highest input bit width
+ 1. This effectively makes the highest bit of the output the carry bit.
